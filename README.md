# Robotics Fundamentals – Kinematics, Path Planning & Simulation

## 📌 Overview
This project covers key concepts in **robot manipulator kinematics** and **trajectory generation**, implemented and simulated using MATLAB. Topics include forward and inverse kinematics, basic path planning, and visualization of manipulator movement.

## 🧠 What It Covers

- **Forward Kinematics:**  
  Computes the end-effector pose using transformation matrices and Denavit–Hartenberg (DH) parameters.

- **Inverse Kinematics:**  
  Solves for joint angles that produce a desired end-effector position.

- **Path Planning:**  
  Implements trajectory generation (e.g., via straight-line paths) in joint and Cartesian space.

- **Simulation & Visualization:**  
  Animates manipulator motion and plots positions across time.
